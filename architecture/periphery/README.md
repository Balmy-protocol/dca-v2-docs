# Periphery

Similarly to Uniswap, Mean Finance v2 is divided in Core and Periphery. Core contains all contracts necessary for the protocol to work, while smart contracts on the Periphery side are designed to support domain-specific interactions with the Core.

The most important contracts are:

* [The Companion](companion.md)
* [The Swapper](swapper.md)
* [Our collection of libraries](libraries.md)
