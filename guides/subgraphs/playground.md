# Playground

In order to execute the queries without having to set up a node environment or an HTTP Client, access to the hosted service of the subgraph you wish to query from.

The subgraph's hosted service endpoint is composed by the deployer name, and the subgraph name: `https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/{DEPLOYER_NAME}/{SUBGRAPH_NAME}`)

Example endpoint to query Mean Finance's subgraph on O**Îž**: [https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/mean-finance/dca-v2-optimism](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/mean-finance/dca-v2-optimism)
