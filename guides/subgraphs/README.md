# Subgraphs

The Graph is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS. Anyone can build and publish open GraphQL APIs, called subgraphs, making data easily accessible.\
\
Additionally GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

There are two main ways of querying a subgraph from your application:

* HTTP Request
* Using a graphql client

Since both are covered in [The Graph - How to query from your app](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developer/querying-from-your-app/#apollo-client) we will mainly focus on how to build queries to fetch data from Mean Finance.
