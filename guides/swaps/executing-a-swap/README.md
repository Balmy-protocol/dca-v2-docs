# Executing a Swap

Once you are ok with the tokens to provide and the reward, you can go ahead and execute the swap. Now, there are a few different ways to do so:

* A [flash swap](regular-swaps.md), where you can borrow liquidity and get the reward first, before returning the required funds
* A ["swap for caller"](swap-for-caller.md), that is much simpler, requires less Ethereum knowledge since you just send the amount needed and then get the reward
* A ["swap with DEX"](swap-with-dex.md), where you don't need to provide any liquidity. You just pay for the gas costs and keep the fee to yourself
